        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¼ cups warm water</li>
            <li>1 cup whole-wheat flour</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup rye flour</li>
            <li>½ cup molasses</li>
            <li>⅓ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon instant coffee granules</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon caraway seeds</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 gallon water</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Directions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
                Combine warm water, whole-wheat flour, and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until the yeast softens and begins to froth and bubble, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
                Mix rye flour, molasses, cocoa powder, vegetable oil, coffee granules, caraway seeds, and salt in a large bowl. Add yeast mixture and all-purpose flour. Turn dough onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Grease a large bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
                Transfer dough to greased bowl; cover with a warm damp towel or plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm area until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
                Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
                Bring water to a boil in a large pot. Divide dough into 13 pieces; shape into balls. Press a hole into the center of each dough ball; pull dough to form a 1-inch hole in the center, keeping dough about 1/2-inch thick. Drop dough circles into boiling water, 3 or 4 at a time. Boil each side for 45 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain for about 1 minute. Arrange boiled bagels on the prepared baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>
                Bake bagels in the preheated oven until just starting to brown on the bottom, 8 to 10 minutes.
