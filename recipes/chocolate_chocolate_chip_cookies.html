        <h1>Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookies Ingredients</h1>
        These are the ingredients you’ll need to make this homemade chocolate chocolate chip cookie recipe:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sugar:</strong>The recipe starts with 1 ½ cups white sugar.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter:</strong>Beat the sugar with two sticks of softened butter.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong>Two eggs lend moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong>Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chocolate chip cookies.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour:</strong>All-purpose flour gives the cookie dough structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Cocoa powder:</strong>They wouldn’t be chocolate chocolate chip cookies without cocoa powder!</li>
            <li><strong>Baking soda:</strong>Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt:</strong>A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won’t make the cookies taste salty.</li>
            <li><strong>Chocolate chips:</strong>You’ll need two cups of semisweet chocolate chips.</li>
            <li><strong>Walnuts (opcional):</strong>Walnuts are optional, but they add welcome crunch. </li>
